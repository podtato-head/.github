# Project _pod_ tato Head
Podtato-head is a cloud-native application built to colorfully
demonstrate delivery scenarios using many different tools and services. It is
intended to help application delivery support teams test and decide which
of these to use.

The podtato-head is a project maintained by members of the [CNCF TAG App Delivery](https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery).

## What is it?

  applications to Kubernetes clusters. The app is maintained in the [podtato-head-app](https://github.com/podtato-head/podtato-head-app) repository.
* A set of delivery scenarios, each of which uses a different tool or service to deliver the app to a Kubernetes cluster. The scenarios are maintained in the [podtato-head-delivery](https://github.com/podtato-head/podtato-head-delivery) repository.
